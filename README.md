Cuatro Vientos airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

The LECU project is a community driven open source project to create a free Cuatro Vientos airport in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
Any contribution is more than wellcome, so if you want to do it, you can collaborate to the project either creating any object of the airport like hangars, buildings... or doing a donation in the page https://avaldesign.com/  

There is no support provided.

It's unlikely that this scenery will harm your computer in any way, but like any piece of software, use it on your own risk. 
I am not responsible for any damage to your computer or MSFS installation.
