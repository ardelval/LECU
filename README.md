# LECU - Cuatro vientos airport


Description
-----------

Cuatro Vientos airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

The LECU project is a community driven open source project to create a free Cuatro Vientos airport in Microsoft Flight Simulator. 
Any contribution is more than wellcome, so if you want to do it, you can collaborate to the project either creating any object 
of the airport like hangars, buildings... or doing a donation in the page https://avaldesign.com/


Installation
------------
You have to unzip the files in the Community folder.  If you’ve installed the game in a custom location, the folder will be in the 
game directory. If you’ve installed it in the default location and you’re using the MS store version, you should look in 
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator(with a bunch of letters and numbers at the end)\LocalCache\Packages.
If you’re using the Steam version, there are two places you should look in. The first is 
%appdata%\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community. The second is in the Steam library folder – \steamapps\common\Community.


Contribution
-------------

There is no support provided, but you can contact me for any question or contribution request at contact@avaldesign.com

It's unlikely that this scenery will harm your computer in any way, but like any piece of software, use it on your own risk. 
I am not responsible for any damage to your computer or MSFS installation.
